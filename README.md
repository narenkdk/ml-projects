# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project focuses on building an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into different categories (e.g., animals, objects, etc.). The primary dataset used in this project is **CIFAR-10**, a popular image classification dataset. Additionally, you can use your own **nature photography dataset** for training and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Build a CNN model to classify images into predefined categories.
- Explore data preprocessing, augmentation, and model evaluation.
- Train and evaluate the model using the CIFAR-10 dataset or custom dataset (e.g., nature images).

### Key Concepts
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Data Augmentation**
- **Model Evaluation**
- **Transfer Learning (Optional for advanced models)**

## Dataset

### CIFAR-10 Dataset:
- **Number of Classes**: 10 (Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck)
- **Image Size**: 32x32 pixels
- **Number of Images**: 60,000 (50,000 training and 10,000 test)

### Custom Dataset:
- You can replace the CIFAR-10 dataset with your own nature photography dataset by organizing the images into folders for each category.
- Example folder structure:
