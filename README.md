**Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks**

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. 

**Goal:**

* Build a robust image classifier to accurately categorize images into predefined classes, such as animals, plants, or objects.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Design and implement CNN architectures (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet) for image feature extraction and classification.
* **Data Augmentation:** Employ techniques like image rotation, flipping, cropping, and zooming to increase dataset size and improve model generalization.

**Dataset:**

* **CIFAR-10:** Utilize the widely-used CIFAR-10 dataset, containing 10 classes of images (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds).
* **Custom Dataset (Optional):** Explore image classification using your own collection of nature photography.

**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the dataset (CIFAR-10 or your custom dataset).
* `models/`: Stores the trained CNN models.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
* `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, OpenCV).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd image-classification
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and preprocess the dataset:**
   * **CIFAR-10:** Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
   * **Custom Dataset:** Prepare your images and organize them into appropriate folders.

4. **Train the model:**
   Run the training script (e.g., `train.py`) with the desired hyperparameters.

5. **Evaluate the model:**
   Run the evaluation script (e.g., `evaluate.py`) to assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Optional Variation: Object Detection**

* **Explore object detection models:** Experiment with popular architectures like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN.
* **Implement object detection:** Train an object detection model to not only classify objects but also localize them within the image.
