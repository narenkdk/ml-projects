**Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Processing**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of customer reviews as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It demonstrates key NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification. Additionally, it explores advanced techniques using pre-trained models like BERT for improved accuracy.

## **Features**
- Clean and preprocess text data (remove HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords).
- Convert text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF** or **CountVectorizer**.
- Train a logistic regression classifier to predict sentiment.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices.
- Experiment with pre-trained models from HuggingFace for state-of-the-art performance.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Natural Language Processing: `nltk`, `re`
  - Machine Learning: `scikit-learn`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Pre-trained Models: `transformers`

## **Dataset**
- **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**: A dataset containing movie reviews with associated sentiment labels (positive/negative).
- Download: [IMDb Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentiment-analysis-nlp.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-nlp
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and preprocess the dataset:
   - Place the dataset in the `data/` directory.
   - Run the preprocessing script:
     ```bash
     python preprocess.py
     ```

---

## **Usage**
1. **Train the Model**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

3. **Run Inference**:
   Use the pre-trained model to predict the sentiment of new reviews:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --text "This movie was fantastic!"
   ```

## **Results**
- **Model Accuracy**: ~85% (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF)
- **Visualization**:
  - Confusion matrix for model evaluation:

## **Future Work**
- Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting key entities.
- Explore advanced models such as BERT or GPT for sentiment analysis.
- Build a web app to deploy the model using **Streamlit** or **Flask**.
